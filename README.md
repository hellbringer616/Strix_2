# Strix-The-Realm
Strix The Realm is a configuration for the NT-RPG plugin by NeumimTo. Suggestions are welcome however this is mostly reserved for my personal server; which you are welcome to join :)

**_Installation instructions_**

For those who want to run Strix, help me find bugs, or just want to use one mans idea of an RPG;
Simply download the source ZIP and drop into your Minecraft Server directory.

**Special Thanks**
